;     Summary:    4-bit data interface, busy flag not implemented.
;                 Any LCD pin can be connected to any available I/O port.
;                 Includes a simple write string routine.
;
; ****************************** Program Notes ******************************
;
;           This program uses a 4-bit data interface but does not use the
;             busy flag to determine when the LCD controller is ready.  The
;             LCD RW line (pin 5) is not connected to the uP and it must be
;             connected to GND for the program to function.
;
;           All time delays are longer than those specified in most datasheets
;             in order to accommodate slower than normal LCD modules.  This
;             requirement is well documented but almost always ignored.  The
;             information is in a note at the bottom of the right hand
;             (Execution Time) column of the instruction set.
;
; ***************************************************************************
;
;           The four data lines as well as the two control lines may be
;             implemented on any available I/O pin of any port.  These are
;             the connections used for this program:

; IMPORTANT - At this point the LCD module is in the 8-bit mode and it is expecting to receive  
;    8 bits of data, one bit on each of its 8 data lines, each time the 'E' line is pulsed.
;
;  Since the LCD module is wired for the 4-bit mode, only the upper four data lines are connected to 
;    the microprocessor and the lower four data lines are typically left open.  Therefore, when 
;    the 'E' line is pulsed, the LCD controller will read whatever data has been set up on the upper 
;    four data lines and the lower four data lines will be high (due to internal pull-up circuitry).
;
;  Fortunately the 'FunctionReset' instruction does not care about what is on the lower four bits so  
;    this instruction can be sent on just the four available data lines and it will be interpreted 
;    properly by the LCD controller.  The 'lcd_write_4' subroutine will accomplish this if the 
;    control lines have previously been configured properly.
